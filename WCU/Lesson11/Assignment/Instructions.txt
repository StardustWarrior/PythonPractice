Assignment
Two other exception types Python gives us are the OverflowError, which happens when a floating-point number 
(a number with a decimal point) is too big to be stored in memory, and the KeyboardInterrupt, which occurs 
when the user presses CTRL + C.

Use the following infinite loop code segment inside a try block. Write two except statements: one for each 
of OverflowError and KeyboardInterrupt. Have the code inside your except statements print the value of number 
so that the user will know how far the loop progressed before the exception occurred.
