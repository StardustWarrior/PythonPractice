Write a program that computes the average of a series of numbers entered by the user. 
To make the program more user-friendly, store all the numbers in a list so that the user's 
numbers can be displayed before the average appears. Have your program stop accepting values 
when the user enters the value -999. Note that this value, -999, should not be averaged in with the other numbers.

Sample output from your program might look like the following:
Please enter a number (-999 quits): 1
Please enter a number (-999 quits): 2
Please enter a number (-999 quits): 3
Please enter a number (-999 quits): 3
Please enter a number (-999 quits): -999
Using the numbers:
1 2 3 3 
The average is: 2.25
