Use your knowledge of the GUI widgets you learned about in this lesson to create a program that allows 
users to enter any text they want. When finished, users will click a Button to display the text in a Label. 
Then they'll be able to control the font style and size. Be sure to give your users the options to make their 
text bold and underlined and provide at least three different font sizes.
