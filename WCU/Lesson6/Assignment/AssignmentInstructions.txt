Now is a great time to implement some of the more useful features of Python classes and finish our Time class. 
Be sure that your class has the following:

The two underscore characters for its variable names to restrict access as much as possible.

A getter and setter function for each of the hour, minute, and second variables. Be sure the set 
functions do the error checking necessary to insure valid times.

A function named tick( ) that will increment the number of seconds by 1. Be aware that this function 
will need to check to be sure that you haven't moved to the next minute or hour.

When you're finished with your new and improved Time class, write a short Python program that creates 
a Time object and works with some of the functions. Inside this program, you might consider writing a 
loop and placing a call to the tick function to watch your time move forward.
